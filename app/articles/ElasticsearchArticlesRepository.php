         * perform the query/filtering on Elasticsearch and load the models from the database
         * than performing the whole query/filtering in the Database itself. Using find($ids)
         * instead of hydrate($sources would also allow you to change the schema in a way
         * that makes sense and facilitates your searches vs. fighting the schema to build
         * a more complex search.
